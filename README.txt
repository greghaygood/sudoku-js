How this app works:

Page loads with a blank 9x9 grid

The numbers fill in one-at-a-time, but quickly. (for initial dev only)
Then numbers are removed based on the complexity level that is set

Complexity levels:
Easy =
Medium =
Hard =
Expert =

App keeps track of numbers that are still in play, and grays them out once all are placed.

Clicking a number highlights all placements of that number on the grid.

Clicking an empty square and then an option number places that number in the square.

Typing a number while an empty square is selected places that number in the square.

App States

When an invalid number is placed in a square, the number will turn red.

When all squares are correctly filled in, the board will turn green.
